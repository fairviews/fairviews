# This program is a short epistolary narrative, where Byron attempts to invite
# several people to dinner. It utilizes lists to hold the names of the 
# characters, then insert(), append(), and pop() to add and remove those
# characters from the list. It was created as a learning exercise for Python,
# following exercise 3-4 in 'Python Crash Course' by Eric Matthes. It was 
# written and tested using Python 3.13.2, and finished on 03-15-2025.
